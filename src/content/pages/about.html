            <p class="cs-text">
                Welcome to Patthira Thai Spa, where authentic Thai healing traditions meet modern wellness practices in the heart of Northampton. Our journey began when our founder, Khun Opol, brought her extensive expertise from Suratthani, Thailand, to create a haven of relaxation and rejuvenation in the UK.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                With over eight years of experience in Thailand's beauty industry and seven Thai massage qualifications, Khun Opol leads our team of highly skilled therapists. Each member of our staff holds prestigious certifications from renowned institutions such as Wat Pho Thai Traditional Medical School, ensuring you receive the highest standard of care and expertise.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Our purpose-designed three-story facility features five specialised treatment rooms, including traditional Thai massage spaces and a couples suite. We've thoughtfully created an environment where traditional Thai practices flourish alongside modern spa amenities, including our relaxing sauna and shower facilities. Every detail, from our premium Thai herbal balms to our professional-grade massage oils, has been carefully selected to enhance your wellness journey.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Established in the same location for 14 years, we're proud to continue the legacy of excellence while bringing fresh expertise and authentic Thai traditions to our valued clients.
